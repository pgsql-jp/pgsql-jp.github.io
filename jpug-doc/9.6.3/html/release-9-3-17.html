      This might well include passwords for other users.
      Adjust the view definition to match the behavior of

      you will need to do the following:

        you'll need to temporarily make it accept connections.
        In <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 9.5 and later, you can use

      (Peter Eisentraut)
     </p><p>      Some selectivity estimation functions in the planner will apply
      user-defined operators to values obtained
      from <code class="structname">pg_statistic</code>, such as most common values and
      histogram entries.  This occurs before table permissions are checked,
      so a nefarious user could exploit the behavior to obtain these values
      for table columns he does not have permission to read.  To fix,
      fall back to a default estimate if the operator's implementation
      function is not certified leak-proof and the calling user does not have
      permission to read the table column whose statistics are needed.
      At least one of these criteria is satisfied in most cases in practice.

      the <code class="envar">PGREQUIRESSL</code> environment variable (Daniel Gustafsson)
     </p><p>      Processing of this environment variable was unintentionally dropped
      in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 9.3, but its documentation remained.
      This creates a security hazard, since users might be relying on the
      environment variable to force SSL-encrypted connections, but that
      would no longer be guaranteed.  Restore handling of the variable,
      but give it lower priority than <code class="envar">PGSSLMODE</code>, to avoid
      breaking configurations that work correctly with post-9.3 code.

      (Robert Haas, Michael Paquier)
     </p><p>      This could result in an unlogged index being set to an invalid state
      after a crash and restart.  Such a problem would persist until the
      index was dropped and rebuilt.

      when a standby server replays a prepared but uncommitted two-phase
      transaction (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      In most cases this turned out to have no visible ill effects, but in
      corner cases it could result in circular references
      in <code class="structname">pg_subtrans</code>, potentially causing infinite loops
      in queries that examine rows modified by the two-phase transaction.

      immediately-preceding DDL (Julien Rouhaud, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Due to lack of a cache flush step between commands in an extension
      script file, non-utility queries might not see the effects of an
      immediately preceding catalog change, such as <code class="command">ALTER TABLE
      ... RENAME</code>.

     </p><p>      The command failed if the calling user did not currently have
      <code class="literal">CREATE</code> privilege for the tablespace containing the index.
      That behavior seems unhelpful, so skip the check, allowing the
      index to be rebuilt where it is.

      be scanned due to conflicting page pins (Andrew Gierth)
     </p><p>      This tended to lead to underestimation of the number of tuples in
      the table.  In the worst case of a small heavily-contended
      table, <code class="command">VACUUM</code> could incorrectly report that the table
      contained no tuples, leading to very bad planning choices.

      (Giuseppe Broccolo, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      In simple cases this caused no ill effects; but for example, a

      they were not marked as belonging to the schema of their associated
      object.

      transmit query cancellation requests to the remote server
      (Michael Paquier, Etsuro Fujita)
     </p><p>      Previously, a local query cancellation request did not cause an

     </p><p>      This fixes a bug affecting some DST transitions in January 2038.

      Switch to numeric abbreviations for numerous time zones in South
      America, the Pacific and Indian oceans, and some Asian and Middle
      Eastern countries.
     </p><p>      The IANA time zone database previously provided textual abbreviations
      for all time zones, sometimes making up abbreviations that have little
      or no currency among the local population.  They are in process of
      reversing that policy in favor of using numeric UTC offsets in zones
      where there is no evidence of real-world use of an English
      abbreviation.  At least for the time being, <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
      will continue to accept such removed abbreviations for timestamp input.

      in MSVC builds (David Rowley)
     </p><p>      The Microsoft MSVC build scripts neglected to install
      the <code class="filename">posixrules</code> file in the timezone directory tree.
      This resulted in the timezone code falling back to its built-in
      rule about what DST behavior to assume for a POSIX-style time zone
      name.  For historical reasons that still corresponds to the DST rules
      the USA was using before 2007 (i.e., change on first Sunday in April
      and last Sunday in October).  With this fix, a POSIX-style zone name
      will use the current and historical DST transition dates of
      the <code class="literal">US/Eastern</code> zone.  If you don't want that, remove
      the <code class="filename">posixrules</code> file, or replace it with a copy of some
      other zone file (see <a class="xref" href="datatype-datetime.html#datatype-timezones" title="8.5.3. 時間帯">8.5.3. 時間帯</a>).  Note that
      due to caching, you may need to restart the server to get such changes
